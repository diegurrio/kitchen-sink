# Diego's Kitchen Sink
Diego's kitchen sink is a collection of simple data structures and algorithms. This repository is meant to act as a second brain to help experienced developers remember how to implement basic patterns and expand on them. The promise is that the code will always be documented, up-to-date, and easy to understand.

## Organization
The code is organized by sections, and each section will be in it's own package.

## Sorting Algorithms
A collection of basic sorting algorithms. This is the stuff that developers usually learn in their second programming course or data structure's class.
