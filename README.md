# Diego's Kitchen Sink
Diego's kitchen sink is a collection of simple data structures and algorithms. This repository is meant to act as a second brain to help experienced developers remember how to implement basic patterns and expand on them. The promise is that the code will always be documented, up-to-date, and easy to understand.

## Organization
The code is organized by sections, and each section will be in it's own package.

## Sorting Algorithms
A collection of basic sorting algorithms. This is the stuff that developers usually learn in their second programming course or data structure's class.

### Bubble Sort
[Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) is the simplest sorting algorithm.
### Merge Sort
[Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
### Quick Sort
[Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961,[2] it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
### Cycle Sort
[Cycle sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sort)  is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array, unlike any other in-place sorting algorithm.
