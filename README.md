# Diego's Kitchen Sink
Diego's kitchen sink is a collection of simple data structures and algorithms. This repository is meant to act as a second brain to help experienced developers remember how to implement basic patterns and expand on them. The promise is that the code will always be documented, up-to-date, and easy to understand.

## Organization
The code is organized by sections, and each section will be in it's own package.

## Sorting Algorithms
A collection of basic sorting algorithms. This is the stuff that developers usually learn in their second programming course or data structure's class.

* [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Cycle sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sort)

## Data Structures
* [Single linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20linked,which%20together%20represent%20a%20sequence.)
* [Binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

## Patterns
This section of the project provides some implemantations for some of the popular patterns described in the popular book called "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" also known as the Gang of four book "[To purchase follow this link](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)"

## F.A.Q.

### Why Android?
I debated whether to make a generic Java project, but I'm mainly an Android developer and the more time I spent in Android studio poking around and creating tests the more experience I get on the platform.
